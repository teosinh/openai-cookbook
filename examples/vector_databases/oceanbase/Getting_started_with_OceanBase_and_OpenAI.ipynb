    "# Using OCEANBASE V4.3.3 as a vector database for OpenAI embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you step by step on using OCEANBASE as a vector database for OpenAI embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an end-to-end process of:\n",
    "1. Using precomputed embeddings created by OpenAI API.\n",
    "2. Storing the embeddings in a cloud instance of OCEANBASE.\n",
    "3. Converting raw text query to an embedding with OpenAI API.\n",
    "4. Using OCEANBASE to perform the nearest neighbour search in the created collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is OCEANBASE V4.3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "[OCEANBASE](https://www.oceanbase.com/) OceanBase V4.3.3 is the first GA release of the 4.3 series, bringing several key breakthroughs. First, on the basis of relational databases, vector types and indexes suitable for AI analysis and processing are supported. Secondly, in order to better meet the requirements of strong isolation of TP and AP resources in HTAP mixed load scenarios, a new form of column-stored replica is introduced. In addition, this release also achieves significant performance improvements for AP query tasks. Other new features include support for complex data types in Array, optimized the computing performance of Roaringbitmap, enhanced the refresh capability of materialized views, expanded the function of foreign tables, improved the performance of foreign table import, and optimized the plan generation and execution policies of AP class SQL to accelerate the improvement of capabilities for OLAP workloads. At the same time, most of the features of V4.2.4 and earlier versions have been supported in V4.3.3, and a new converged version will be released in the future, which is also applicable to OLTP services.\n",
